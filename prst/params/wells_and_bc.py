class BoundaryCondition(object):
    """
    Stores boundary conditions for grid.

    There can only be a single boundary condition per face in the grid. This is
    now enforced. Solvers assume boundary conditions are given on the boundary;
    conditions in the interior of the domain yield unpredictable results.

    Synopsis:

        bc = BoundaryCondition()
        bc = BoundaryCondition(one_face, "pressure", np.array([10000000]))
        bc = BoundaryCondition(three_faces, "flux", np.array([1,2,3]))
        bc.add(np.array([120, 121]), "flux", 5)
        bc.add(faces, "pressure", 1000000)

    Arguments:

      faces(ndarray):
        Global face indices in external model for which this boundary condition
        should be applied. Must have shape (n,).

      type(1d ndarray or string):
        Type of boundary condition. Supported values are "pressure" and "flux",
        or a 1d array of strings.

      values(1D ndarray or scalar):
        Boundary condition value. Interpreted as a pressure value (in units of
        Pascal) when type=="pressure" and as a flux value (in units of m^3/s)
        when type=="flux". One scalar value for each face in `faces`.

        Note: If type=="flux", the values are interpreted as injection flux. To
        specify an extraction flux (i.e., flux out of the reservoir), the
        caller should provide a negative value.

      sat(Optional[ndarray]):
        Fluid composition of fluid injected across inflow faces. An array of
        shape (n,m) of fluid compositions with `n` being the number of faces in
        `faces` and for m=3, the columns interpreted as 0<->Aqua, 1<->Liquid,
        2<->Vapor.

        This field is for the benefit of transport solvers such as
        `blackoilUpwFE` (only in MRST, not PRST) and will be ignored for
        outflow faces.

        Default value: sat=None (assume single-phase flow).

    Properties:
        - face: External faces for which explicit BCs are provided. 1D-ndarray.
        - type: 1D-array of strings denoting type of BC.
        - value:  Boundary condition values for all faces in `face`. They
          correspond to either pressure or flux values, as given by `bcType`.
        - sat: Fluid composition of fluids passing through inflow faces.

    Methods:

      add(...): Adds boundary conditions to an existing object. The syntax is
      the same as the BoundaryCondition initializer.

    Note:
      For convenience, the pressure and flux parameters may be scalar. The
      value is then used for all faces specified in the faces parameter.

            the entire corresponding local axis of `side` in the grid `G`. The

        I2 (list or ndarray):
            Index range for global axis perpendicular to `side`. The primary
            purpose of this parameter is to exclude faces *within* a reservoir
            from being added to the return value `ix`. Such faces typically
            occur in faulted reservoirs where a given face may be considered
